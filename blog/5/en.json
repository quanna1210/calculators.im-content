Income</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">Your gross monthly income forms the foundation of your home buying power. Lenders typically look at your total household income from all sources, including:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc pl-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Regular salary or wages</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Bonuses and commissions</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Investment income</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Alimony or child support (if you choose to disclose it)</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Side business income</li>\n                            </ul>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">2. Debt</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">Your existing debt obligations directly impact how much additional debt (in the form of a mortgage) you can responsibly take on. Lenders consider:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc pl-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Car loans</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Student loans</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Credit card debt</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Personal loans</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Other mortgages</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Child support or alimony payments</li>\n                            </ul>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">3. Down Payment</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">The amount you can put down upfront significantly affects your mortgage terms:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc pl-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Larger down payments typically result in better interest rates</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Down payments of 20% or more eliminate the need for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">First-time home buyer programs may offer lower down payment options</li>\n                            </ul>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">4.

Interest Rates</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">Current mortgage interest rates directly affect your monthly payment and overall affordability. Even a 0.5% difference in rate can significantly impact how much house you can afford.</p>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">6. Term Length</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">The length of your mortgage affects both your monthly payment and total interest paid:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc pl-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">30-year mortgages offer lower monthly payments but higher total interest</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">15-year mortgages have higher monthly payments but build equity faster and save on interest</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </section>\n\n                        <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                            <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">How to Use a Mortgage Calculator</h2>\n\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">A <a class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-red-500 active:text-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 transform active:scale-95 transition-transform duration-100\" href=\"/mortgage-calculator\">mortgage calculator</a> is a powerful tool that combines all these factors to give you a clear picture of your home buying budget.
