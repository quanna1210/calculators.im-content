        <p class=\"mb-4\">For a $300,000, 30-year mortgage at 6%, five years in:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc ml-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li

payoff calculator</strong> shows that front-loading extra payments maximizes interest savings.</p>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">Refinancing to a Shorter Term</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">Rather than simply making extra payments, some homeowners formalize their commitment by refinancing to a shorter term:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc ml-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Current loan</strong>: $250,000 balance, 25 years remaining at 6% = $1,603 monthly</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Refinanced loan</strong>: $250,000, 15-year at 5.5% = $2,044 monthly</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Result</strong>: $441 higher monthly payment but loan paid off 10 years sooner with $150,000+ interest savings</li>\n                            </ul>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">This approach works well for homeowners who receive salary increases and want to commit to faster payoff.</p>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">The Mortgage Recast Option</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">Less known than refinancing, mortgage recasting keeps your existing loan terms but recalculates your <strong>amortization schedule</strong> after a substantial principal payment:</p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc ml-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Make a significant principal payment (typically $10,000 minimum)</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Lender recalculates your loan based on the new balance but same interest rate and term</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Monthly payment decreases, but loan payoff date remains unchanged</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Typically involves a small fee ($250-$500)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">This strategy works well for windfall situations when you want lower payments without refinancing costs.</p>\n
