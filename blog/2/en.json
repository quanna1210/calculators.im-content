Dave Ramsey's calculator showed me that by adding just $300 extra per month, I could shorten my 30-year mortgage to about 22 years and save nearly $50,000 in interest. This motivated me to adjust my budget and start making additional payments. The visual representation of how each extra payment reduced my loan term was incredibly motivating.\n                            </p>\n                        </section>\n\n                        <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                            <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Comparison of Calculators</h2>\n                            <div class=\"overflow-x-auto mb-6\">\n                                <table class=\"min-w-full bg-white border border-gray-200\">\n                                    <thead>\n                                        <tr>\n                                            <th class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200 font-semibold text-left\">Calculator</th>\n                                            <th class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200 font-semibold text-left\">Strengths</th>\n                                            <th class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200 font-semibold text-left\">Weaknesses</th>\n                                            <th class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200 font-semibold text-left\">Best For</th>\n                                        </tr>\n                                    </thead>\n                                    <tbody>\n                                        <tr>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">[host_name]</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Simple, visual, easy to use</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Fewer advanced features</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Beginners, quick calculations</td>\n                                        </tr>\n                                        <tr>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">NerdWallet</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Comprehensive, includes all costs</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Can be overwhelming initially</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Those wanting detailed analysis</td>\n                                        </tr>\n                                        <tr>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Bankrate</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">User-friendly, educational</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Fewer customization options</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">First-time homebuyers</td>\n                                        </tr>\n                                        <tr>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Zillow</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Integration with real property data</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Requires personal information for some features</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Active home searchers</td>\n                                        </tr>\n                                        <tr>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Dave Ramsey</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Focus on early payoff</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Fewer comparison features</td>\n                                            <td class=\"py-3 px-4 border-b border-gray-200\">Those wanting to pay off debt quickly</td>\n                                        </tr>\n                                    </tbody>\n                                </table>\n                            </div>\n                        </section>\n\n                        <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                            <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">How to Effectively Use a Mortgage Calculator</h2>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                                After years of using these tools, I've learned some tips to maximize their value:\n                            </p>\n\n                            <ol class=\"list-decimal pl-6 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">\n                                    <strong>Understand the inputs</strong>: Make sure you understand what you're entering.
