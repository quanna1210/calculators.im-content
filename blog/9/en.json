Over a 30-year mortgage, this adds up to over $108,000 in additional costs.\n                            </p>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                                By visualizing these differences, you can make strategic decisions about whether to:\n                            </p>\n                            <ul class=\"list-disc pl-8 mb-6\">\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Wait longer to save a larger down payment</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Proceed with a smaller down payment but plan to refinance once you reach 20% equity</li>\n                                <li class=\"mb-2\">Investigate down payment assistance programs for <strong>first-time buyers</strong></li>\n                            </ul>\n                            <img src=\"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/quanna1210/calculators.im-content/refs/heads/master/upload/image/9/image-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Down payment visualization with pie charts\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-md my-6\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">4.

Using a mortgage calculator, he discovered that increasing his down payment to 10% ($30,000) would significantly reduce his PMI costs. He postponed his home search for six months to save the additional $10,000, ultimately saving over $15,000 in PMI payments over the life of his loan.\n                            </p>\n\n                            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">The Term Optimizer</h3>\n                            <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                                Jessica and Carlos were deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage. While the 15-year option offered a lower interest rate, they worried about committing to the higher monthly payments. Using a <strong>mortgage calculator</strong>, they chose a 30-year loan but set up automatic extra payments equivalent to a 20-year payoff schedule. This approach gave them payment flexibility during tight financial months while still reducing their overall interest costs significantly.\n                            </p>\n                        </section>\n\n                        <section class=\"mb-8\" id=\"faq\">\n                            <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 text-center\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n                            <details class=\"group border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4\" open=\"\">\n                                <summary class=\"cursor-pointer flex justify-between items-center\">\n                                    <h3 class=\"text-lg font-medium\">Why are mortgage calculators essential for first-time home buyers?</h3>\n                                    <svg class=\"w-5 h-5 text-gray-500 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                        <path stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" d=\"M19 9l-7 7-7-7\"></path>\n                                    </svg>\n                                </summary>\n                                <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-600\">\n                                    Mortgage calculators help first-time buyers understand true affordability beyond just the purchase price.
