In our current Gregorian calendar, a typical year has 365 days, but in a <strong>leap year</strong>, there are 366 days as February gains an extra day.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">How Does a Leap Year Checker Work?</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    A Leap Year Checker is a tool designed to determine whether a given year qualifies as an extra day year. Its algorithm follows a simple set of rules: first, check if the year is divisible by 4; if not, it is a common year. For years divisible by 4, if the year is also divisible by 100, it might not qualify unless it is divisible by 400.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    For example, consider the year 2024:\n                </p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Step 1: 2024 is divisible by 4.</li>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Step 2: 2024 is not a century year, so no further check is needed.</li>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Conclusion: 2024 qualifies as an extra day year.</li>\n                </ul>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">The Importance of Knowing Calendar Adjustments</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Accurate calendar calculations are essential for scheduling events, software development, and personal planning.

However, if the year is a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to qualify. This rule ensures that the calendar stays accurate over long periods.\n                </p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Divisible by 4: Qualifies for consideration.</li>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Divisible by 100: Requires additional verification.</li>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Divisible by 400: Confirms qualification.</li>\n                </ul>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Historical and Astronomical Perspectives</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    The concept of adding an extra day has a rich history, evolving from ancient calendar reforms to the modern Gregorian adjustments.
