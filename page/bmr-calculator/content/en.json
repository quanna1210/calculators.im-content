These functions include breathing, circulation, cell production, and temperature regulation. In simple terms, BMR is the energy required for survival when you are not engaged in any physical activity.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Understanding your BMR gives you insight into the minimum number of calories needed to sustain life. This information is crucial for anyone looking to manage weight, plan a diet, or optimize a training routine. It also provides the baseline for calculating your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which incorporates all daily physical activities.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">How to Calculate Your BMR</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Many people ask, \"How do I <strong>Calculate BMR</strong> accurately?\" The most widely used method is the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. This equation considers your age, weight, height, and gender to provide a reliable estimate of your BMR.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    The equations for men and women are slightly different:\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    For men:\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    <code>BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) - 5 × age (years) + 5</code>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    For women:</p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    <code>BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) - 5 × age (years) - 161</code>\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    These formulas form the basis of the <strong>BMR calculation formula for men and women</strong> and are widely used to assess how many calories your body burns at rest.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Why Knowing Your BMR Is Important</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Knowing your BMR is the first step towards effective weight management. It allows you to understand your body’s calorie requirements, ensuring that you consume just the right amount for your specific goals. Whether you aim to lose, maintain, or gain weight, your BMR provides the foundation for your daily calorie needs.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    For example, if you’re trying to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body burns. On the other hand, if you’re looking to build muscle, you’ll need to consume more calories than your body requires at rest. Thus, understanding <strong>BMR and calories</strong> is a crucial element of any diet or exercise plan.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">BMR vs. TDEE: What’s the Difference?</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    While <strong>Basal metabolic rate</strong> measures the energy required at rest, Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) takes into account the calories burned through all physical activities.
