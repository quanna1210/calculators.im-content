With drunk driving risks on the rise, a reliable <strong>BAC Calculator</strong> or Blood Alcohol Calculator can make a big difference. This guide explains how these tools work, the science behind them, what impacts your BAC, and why it matters legally—all in plain English!\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">What Is Blood Alcohol Concentration?</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) shows how much alcohol is in your blood as a percentage. For example, a BAC of 0.08% means 0.08% of your blood is alcohol. The higher your BAC, the more impaired you might feel—think slower reactions or trouble thinking clearly. Tools like an Alcohol Level Calculator or Blood Alcohol Calculator help you check your level after a drink.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">The Science Behind BAC</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Your body handles alcohol in a cool way. After drinking, alcohol goes from your stomach to your blood, then gets processed by your liver. How fast this happens depends on your weight, gender, how much you drank, and when you started. That’s why a <strong>BAC Calculator</strong> uses these details to estimate your level accurately.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Common Ways to Calculate BAC</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    There are a few ways to figure out your BAC, and the Widmark formula is a popular one. It looks at how much alcohol you drank, your weight, and your gender. Online calculators tweak this with extra info for better results.\n                </p>\n                <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">The Widmark Formula</h3>\n                    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                        Here’s the simple version of the Widmark formula:\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                        <em>BAC = (Alcohol in Grams / (Weight in Grams × r)) – (β × Time)</em>\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                        In this, \"r\" is different for men (0.68) and women (0.55), and \"β\" is how fast your body burns off alcohol. It’s a key way to learn <strong>how to calculate blood alcohol concentration</strong> and powers many BAC tools online.\n                    </p>\n                </section>\n                <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">Other Ways to Calculate</h3>\n                    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                        Some calculators also factor in the type of drink, its strength (ABV), and how long you’ve been drinking.
