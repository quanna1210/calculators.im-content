Our comprehensive Boolean Algebra Calculator provides an intuitive platform to evaluate complex logical expressions, generate <strong>truth tables</strong>, and visualize Boolean operations in real-time.</p>\n       </section>\n\n       <section class=\"mb-8\">\n           <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\" id=\"what-is-boolean-algebra\">What is Boolean Algebra?</h2>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">Boolean algebra, developed by mathematician George Boole in the 19th century, is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations on true and false values. In digital systems, these values are typically represented as 1 (true) and 0 (false). This mathematical system provides the theoretical foundation for <strong>digital circuit design</strong>, computer programming, and <strong>logical reasoning</strong>.</p>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">The fundamental operations in Boolean algebra include AND, OR, NOT, and XOR operations. Each operation follows specific rules that govern how logical values interact with each other. Understanding these operations is essential for anyone working with digital systems, from simple logic circuits to complex computer processors.</p>\n       </section>\n\n       <section class=\"mb-8\">\n           <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\" id=\"core-boolean-operations-explained\">Core Boolean Operations Explained</h2>\n           \n           <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">AND Operation (∧)</h3>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">The AND operation returns true only when both inputs are true. In practical terms, this means that all conditions must be satisfied for the output to be true. For example, in the expression A AND B, the result is <strong>true only when both A and B are true</strong>.</p>\n\n           <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">OR Operation (∨)</h3>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">The OR operation returns true when at least one input is true. This operation represents logical addition, where any true input will result in a true output. The expression A OR B is <strong>false only when both A and B are false</strong>.</p>\n\n           <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">NOT Operation (¬)</h3>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">The NOT operation, also called negation or inversion, simply reverses the input value. If the input is true, NOT makes it false, and vice versa. This <strong>unary operation</strong> is fundamental to creating <strong>complex logical expressions</strong>.</p>\n\n           <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">XOR Operation (⊕)</h3>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">The Exclusive OR (XOR) operation returns true when inputs are different. Unlike the regular OR operation, XOR returns false when both inputs are the same, whether both true or both false. This operation is particularly useful in <strong>digital communications</strong> and <strong>error detection</strong>.</p>\n       </section>\n\n       <section class=\"mb-8\">\n           <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\" id=\"the-importance-of-truth-tables\">The Importance of Truth Tables</h2>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">Truth tables provide a systematic way to visualize all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs for Boolean expressions. These tables are invaluable tools for:</p>\n           <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mb-4\">\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Circuit Design</strong>: Engineers use truth tables to design digital circuits that perform specific logical functions</li>\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Software Development</strong>: Programmers rely on Boolean logic to create conditional statements and control program flow</li>\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>System Analysis</strong>: Truth tables help identify potential issues in logical systems before implementation</li>\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Academic Learning</strong>: Students use truth tables to understand and verify Boolean expressions</li>\n           </ul>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">Our Boolean Algebra Calculator automatically generates comprehensive truth tables for any expression you input, making it easy to visualize how different <strong>input combinations</strong> affect the <strong>output</strong>.</p>\n       </section>\n\n       <section class=\"mb-8\">\n           <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\" id=\"advanced-boolean-expression-evaluation\">Advanced Boolean Expression Evaluation</h2>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">Complex Boolean expressions often involve multiple variables and operations combined with parentheses to control precedence. Understanding <strong>operator precedence</strong> is crucial for correctly evaluating these expressions:</p>\n           <ol class=\"list-decimal pl-6 mb-4\">\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>NOT operations</strong> have the highest precedence</li>\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>AND operations</strong> come next</li>\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>OR operations</strong> have lower precedence</li>\n               <li class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Parentheses</strong> can override default precedence</li>\n           </ol>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">For example, the expression `(A OR B) AND NOT C` first evaluates the parentheses, then applies the NOT operation to C, and finally performs the AND operation between the results.</p>\n       </section>\n\n       <section class=\"mb-8\">\n           <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\" id=\"practical-applications-in-computer-science\">Practical Applications in Computer Science</h2>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">Boolean algebra isn't just theoretical—it has countless practical applications in modern technology:</p>\n\n           <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">Digital Circuit Design</h3>\n           <p class=\"mb-4\">Every digital device, from smartphones to supercomputers, relies on Boolean logic gates.
