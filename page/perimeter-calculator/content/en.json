Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, the formula simplifies to: <em>P = 2 × (length + width)</em>. For example, if a rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units, the perimeter is 30 units.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Perimeter of a Circle</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    The boundary of a circle, known as the <strong>Perimeter of Circle</strong> or circumference, is calculated using the formula: <em>P = 2πr</em>, where <em>r</em> is the radius. For instance, a circle with a radius of 7 units has a perimeter of approximately 44 units.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Perimeter of a Triangle</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    For a triangle, the perimeter is simply the sum of its three side lengths. For example, if a triangle has sides measuring 3, 4, and 5 units, its <strong>Perimeter of triangle</strong> is 12 units.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Perimeter of a Polygon</h3>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    In general, the perimeter of a polygon is the sum of all its side lengths. For regular polygons, this simplifies to the number of sides multiplied by the length of one side. When dealing with irregular shapes, each side must be measured individually and then summed. In complex figures, you might need to compute the <strong>perimeter of pologon</strong> to ensure every edge is accounted for.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    This method illustrates the versatility of techniques used to determine the <strong>perimeter of pologon</strong> in various practical applications.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">Benefits of Using a Perimeter Calculator</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">\n                    Utilizing a Perimeter Calculator provides significant advantages including increased efficiency and speed.
