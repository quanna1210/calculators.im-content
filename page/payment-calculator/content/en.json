For a standard loan, the monthly payment (EMI) can be calculated using the formula: </p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\"><code>EMI = (P × r × (1+r)<sup>n</sup>) / ((1+r)<sup>n</sup> – 1)</code></p>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">where P is the principal loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12), and n is the total number of monthly payments.
