Here are three common percentage calculations:</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Percentage of a Number: Formula: Result = (Percentage / 100) × Number. Example: 25% of 80 = (25 / 100) × 80 = 20.</li>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">Percentage Increase: Formula: Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) × 100. Example: From 50 to 75 = ((75 - 50) / 50) × 100 = 50%.</li>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">What Percent of X is Y: Formula: Percentage = (Y / X) × 100. Example: 30 out of 200 = (30 / 200) × 100 = 15%.</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Our free calculator automates these formulas, saving you time and effort.</p>\n            </section>\n\n            <section class=\"mb-8\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-4\">Real-Life Examples of Using a Percentage Calculator</h2>\n                <p class=\"mb-4\">Let’s see how this tool applies to everyday scenarios:</p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li class=\"mb-2\">For Students: You scored 45 out of 60 on a test.
